# GTOC13

This is a solution framework for [the 13th Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition](https://sophia.estec.esa.int/gtoc_portal/?page_id=1360), written by Gunhee Yi ([ghyi@kaist.ac.kr](mailto:ghyi@kaist.ac.kr)), a member of team KAIST that participated the competition. This repository was generated by extracting the part that I contributed out from our team's repository. And this repository itself does contain some codes written by my teammates: Jinsung Lee, Jaewoo Kim and Mercury (Hangyeol) Kim.

Our team did not rank at a high place (30th place in the end), so I recommend you to also refer to solutions from other highly-ranked teams which will be released to the official website in the near future as far as I know.

A tutorial script for this framework can be found in the following name: `example.m`.
